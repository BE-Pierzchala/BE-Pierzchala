## Hi! 👋🏻

I'm someone who's passionate about **understanding the world** around us and enjoys **writing code**.

I primarily work in ***nix** operating systems and **python**, but I know a range of other languages including **C++** and **Java**.

I love to learn and share my knowledge. Here you can find some of my projects I did, either because I found them fun or wanted to learn a new skill.

If you find value in something I have created do not hesitate to contact me!
